LINQ is used to work with data access from sources such as objects,
data sets, SQL Server, and XML. LINQ stands for Language Integrated Query.
LINQ is a data query API with SQL like syntaxes.
LINQ provides a query cached data from all kinds of data sources.
The data source could be a collection on objects, database or XML files/
We can easily retrieve data from any object that implements the IENumerable<T> Interface.

The main goal of LINQ is to add "general purpose query facilities" to
the .NET Framework that apply to all sources of information, not just
relational XML data.
